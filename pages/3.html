									<h1>Water tap for the Hilux!</h1>
									<p>We bought an underbody water tank for the Hilux. It came with everything except a bracket to hold the tap.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="3/Ren2.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>My mate and I was preparing to go for a 3 day long camping trip. We wanted to carry some serious water with us and ordered a bolt on under body water tank kit on ebay. We spent an entire day putting everything together and realized that they haven't included any mounting hardware for the tap.</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="3/TapAssembly v2.png" alt="" /></span>This I just after I got my 3D printer and to be honest, I was actually happy that it was missing something. I got my trusty caliper out and went to town. Fusion 360 is my go to CAD software at this point. It could've been straightforward to design some kind of a mount that does the job easily. But the perfectionist in me decided to do hidden paths to route zip ties. After spending some time on it I was happy how it looked like. My plan was to sandwich two parts around the main chassis under the car. Then four self tapping screws hold the two pieces together creating a pretty solid mount.</p>
								<p>All the parts were printed in ABS to give it a good chance of surviving under a four wheel drive. I also gave it a paint job with some primer and black paint to match it to the car a little bit since the only ABS filament i had was white.</p>

								<p>You can find all the CAD and STL files in my github</p>

							<h2>Addendum - October 23, 2021</h2>
							<p>So we are back home from our camping trip. We prepared for days to prepare food and water. We thought we covered everything. Once we got there we realized we have left all the meat in the freezer and most importantly, <b>forgot to fill up our newly installed tank with water.</b> That is all.</p>
